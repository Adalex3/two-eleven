# HackGT 9: Two^Eleven
!["UI Design of the app"](https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_photos/002/266/823/datas/gallery.jpg)
## What it does
Two^Eleven uses the classic mobile game 2048 as a decoy for a system of discreet recording mechanisms, file storing, and emergency report to assist victims of domestic violence in documenting their situation. To the normal eye, the app looks and works like nothing more than a simple game to avoid suspicion, but holding onto the screen for 3 seconds will reveal a menu of different actions disguised onto the first row of the 2048 board. The user can subtly gesture to start an audio or video recording, to open the storage library, or to trigger emergency mode. In this state, the app will send an SOS message to the user’s chosen emergency contacts with the current location of the user and ask them to call local authorities to the location.
